 📌 About the Project
This repository serves as a personal coding journal and a guide for anyone starting their Java journey. It focuses on solving problems step-by-step, moving from basic syntax to complex logic building.

 🛠️ Key Topics Covered
The code is organized into specific modules:

* ⚡ Control Flow: Mastering `if-else` logic and `switch` statements.
* 🔄 Iteration: Deep dive into `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
* 🔢 Arrays: Operations on 1D and 2D arrays (searching, sorting).
* ✨ Pattern Printing:A dedicated section for star and number patterns to sharpen logical thinking.
**📦 Functions: Understanding modularity and reusability.
